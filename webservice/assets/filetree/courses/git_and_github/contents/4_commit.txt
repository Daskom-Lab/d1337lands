You can see all the staged changes right ? Cool, now you can run `git commit -m "your commit message"` to commit all those staged changes.

For example, you can run it like this:

```
git commit -m "add some memes"
```

Commit means that all the staged changes will become a `version` in your changes history, which means that you can get back to that `version` or even just take some of the changes from a `version` to merge to your current one.

Commiting changes will take effect only in your local machine, to make it also available in the remote git server (github in this case), you have to run git push but thats something to talk about in the next section.
