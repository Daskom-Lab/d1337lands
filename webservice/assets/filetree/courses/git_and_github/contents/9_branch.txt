BRANCH!

Just like tree that have leaves and branches, git also have branch, in fact the version history that we always talking about is called version tree, which is why there are also branches here.

`main` that you encounter before in the last section, is one kind of branch, branch is something like a forked repository but instead of being another repository it stays inside of it.

It has its own version history, much like forked repository.

Lets make a diagram to clear this one out, suppose there is a person whose username is `m4nINthe_m11dle`, this person have a repository called `songs-without-melodies`, remember that the default branch of a repository will be either master/main (most of the times) but one can have unique naming for thie one too, but in this case lets say the default branch is `main`:

+----------------------------------------+
| m4nINthe_m11dle/songs-without-melodies |
|               ----                     |
|           in main branch               |
+----------------------------------------+

And then that person has a friend whose username is `4chan4ever`, he creates a branch called `meine_work` in that repository, now the diagram look like this:

+----------------------------------------+     +----------------------------------------+
| m4nINthe_m11dle/songs-without-melodies |     | m4nINthe_m11dle/songs-without-melodies |
|               ----                     | --- |               ----                     |
|           in main branch               |     |           in meine_work branch         |
+----------------------------------------+     +----------------------------------------+

Yes, the repository stay the same, the owner of the repository stay the same, but now it has two branches inside.

Now suppose 4chan4ever commited and pushed 2 new version to the meine_work branch called "add something uwu", and "delete something uwu, its now uwu", respectively.

Now the diagram will look like this (this time we remove the repository name to simplify things as that one wont change):

                                   +-------------------+
                                   | meine_work branch | (4chan4ever) [delete something uwu, its now uwu]
                                   +-------------------+
                                             |
                                             |
                                     [add something uwu]
                                             |
                                             |
+-------------+                              |
| main branch | (m4nINthe_m11dle)      [initial commit]
+-------------+

Those two different branches are not in the same version anymore, now to make things brutal (just like how it always be during work XD), m4nINthe_m11dle commited and pushed 1 new version to the main branch called "refactor all things".

Now the diagram will look like this:

                                   +-------------------+              [delete something
                                   | meine_work branch | (4chan4ever) uwu, its now uwu]
                                   +-------------------+
                                             |
+-------------+ [refactor all                |
| main branch | things]             [add something uwu]
+-------------+                              |
       |                                     |
       |                                     |
        \------- [initial commit] ----------/

Do you understand it ? no ? sorry, i know its complicated.

Lets jump right to practical things then, go to the directory of d1337lands of your own forked repository in your local machine, and then type `git branch` it should now show you all branches that are available in your current forked repository, to close this simply press escape button.

Now, do you remember that you can see all version history in the github website ? you can do it locally too!

Type `git log` and you will see them.

And then to make things easier (or not) to diagram, you can run this command instead:
```
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
```

If you find it hard to remember that command, as a wise man (from stackoverflow) once said,
```
Not everyone would be doing a git log all the time, but when you need it just remember:
"A Dog" = git log --[a]ll --[d]ecorate --[o]neline --[g]raph
```

BTW, you will probably see just a straight graph, it is because its only has one branch in the original d1337lands repository, at least by the time this text is written.

Cool right, now lets try creating a new branch called `{your_username} work`, by using this command:
```
git checkout -b "{your_username} work"
```

That will create the branch and get inside (checkout) it.

Try to create one or more commits on that branch by doing the same thing you have done before in section 3 and 4, and see the version tree using the git log command.

And btw if you want to checkout to existing branch, you can do so by using this command:
```
git checkout "{target branch}"
```

just like the one before but without the `-b` option.
