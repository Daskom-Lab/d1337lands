Hello there, and welcome to the Git and Github course!

If you are reading this with the intention to learn it, chances are you might not know what is Git let alone Github. Dont take it too hard, just think about this way, have you ever had a situation in which you have to "version" your files or something, such as:

[iteration 1>] tugas_kalkulus.doc
[iteration 2>] tugas_kalkulus2.doc
[iteration 3>] tugas_kalkulusfinal.doc
[iteration 4>] tugas_kalkulusfinalfinal.doc
[iteration 5>] tugas_kalkulusfinalfinalbanget.doc
[iteration 6>] tugas_kalkulusAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.doc

Dont be shy, i know everyone have ever tried this at least once in their whole life, right, right?!

Say no more to things like this, this is the reason why Git and Github existed in the first place, they come to save all our lives by making it **a lot** easier to "version" our files, in fact thats also why they are called VCS that stands for Version Control System which is a system that you can use to control each "version" of your files (sounds obvious isnt it ?).

Okay, but why do we need this ? well, unless you want to stay traditional, classical, and (no offense) being like a boomer, Git and Github will be helpful to make you be:

[+] More productive (version your files without thinking of different names),
[+] More resilient (you can get your files back even if you mistakenly delete the whole directory for some reason),
[+] More organized (all your files and directories will always look really clean and prevent you from getting messy)
[+] More popular (if you put every codes you made in your github account, trust me, even company will try to reach you to get you working for them **even without having to go through technical interviews**)

So, at this point, i dont think you will need other reason to learn this, and in that case, go ahead and learn it by reading all course contents inside the contents directory, i promised you that this knowledge wont go to waste!
