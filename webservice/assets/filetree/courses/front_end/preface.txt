Hello and welcome to front-end content \^o^/ !!!

In this section we're gonna start to develop a web from the scratch, front-end using HTML, CSS, and JS.

what is front-end?

In every website, there's 3 important thing to make a website: HTML, CSS, and JS.

Those 3 are used to make an appearance of website. 

HTML, CSS, and JS usually called the skeleton, the skin, and the brain.

--> HTML as skeleton of the web is as it's name, it builds the content of the web without any style and on of markup language.

--> Second is CSS, if a human only have skeleton it will scare y'all right? that's why human has a skin, hair and etc. for it's appearance whether it'll become beautiful or handsome. same as the web, if you see a website that only built from HTML, it won't attract the reader, so the CSS that will give the skin or appearance in website.

--> Last is JS or javascript, it's the brain of website, if you see in online shop like tokopedia, you'll see a sliding image like powerpoint, or when you make an order in Gofood, you can see how much you've order, it probably use JS as it's code.

All of that is part of front-end, so we can say front-end is part of website that user or customer interact with.

Who is the person who build that appearance? it is a front-end developer.

So front-end developer is someone who will develop the front-end part that UI (User Interface) designer give.
