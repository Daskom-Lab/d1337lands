============= STYLESHEET LINK =================

When styling in your stylesheet, don't forget to link your stylesheet in index.html at head element.

        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

============= MARGIN SET =================

after you've linked it, now we're gonna set the font, and margin of body and container class. 

body margin and padding will be set to 0 so there will be no white space left at the navbar.

at your stylesheet, add:

            body {
            font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            }      

            .container {
                max-width: 1170px;
                margin: 0 auto; /* it will set the right and left margin follow the width */
            }

============= FLOAT LEFT AND RIGHT =================

margin nhas been set, now we will make the structure

we can simply set the left-nav to be float: left and the right-nav to be float: right.

float property will make the element floated to a set direction like picture above.

so we're gonna add in stylesheet:
               
                .right-nav {
                    float: right;
                    margin-right: -25px;
                }

                .left-nav {
                    float: left;
                }            

after you add that, see the difference it makes.

============= NAVBAR COLOR =================

now we're gonna set the color to make it more colorfull. 

we can select the <nav> and set the background color you like and set the height of your navbar.

Because I like blue color, so we're gonna set it to blue and for the height we'll set it to 65 px.

                nav {
                    height: 65px;
                    background-color: #528aae;
                }

the navbar color has been changed, but the text hasn't changed, so we're gonna set it to white and make it center so

we can read it more clearly.

                .right-nav a, .left-nav a{          /* It will change both of em */
                    line-height: 65px;
                    color: white;
                }

It is a bit narrow for the right-nav isn't it? let's add some padding!!

                .right-nav a{
                    line-height: 65px;
                    padding: 0 25px;
                    color: white;
                }

                .left-nav a{
                    line-height: 65px;
                    padding: 0 25px;
                    color: white;
                }

now it looked like a navbar right?? but it is still tooooooo plain, let's add the makeup more ^_^

============= MOREEEEE ===============

do you see some underlined text in the <a> tags? it bothers no? so we're gonna make it disappear!!

we're gonna set * text-decoration: none * so the decoration like that underline will be gone for all <a> tags.

                a {
                    text-decoration: none;
                }

now the underline gone, we'll add some hover effect at the menu to make it cooler.

============= HOVERED COLOR ===============

To make a change to an element when hovered, we've learned it before in 7_css_selector. what change wil be made?

Here we'll set the color of the box will be darker when hovered for both left and right nav, so the code is:

                .right-nav :hover, .left-nav :hover{
                    color: #1975af;
                }

But with those code, it just changed the text color, how if we want to change the text box color?

we must set the <a> tags of right and left nav display to block, so it will become block-like structure.

                .right-nav a {
                    line-height: 65px;
                    padding: 0 25px;
                    display: block;
                    color: white;
                    float: left; /* to make it horizontal align (see the difference when there's no float in block) */
                }

                .left-nav a {
                    line-height: 65px;
                    display: block;
                    color: white;
                }

And after that, if before we changed the color of right/left-nav, now we're gonna change it to background-color so the whole box will be changed.

before: 

                .right-nav :hover, .left-nav :hover{
                    color: #1975af;
                }

after: 
                .right-nav :hover, .left-nav :hover{
                    background-color: #1975af;
                }

and make it smoother with transition.

                .right-nav :hover, .left-nav :hover{
                    background-color: #1975af;
                    transition: 0.5s; /* it will give some time to the targeted effect */
                }

                .right-nav a {
                    line-height: 65px;
                    padding: 0 25px;
                    display: block;
                    color: white;
                    float: left;
                    transition: 0.5s; /* it will give some time to the targeted effect */
                }

                .left-nav a {
                    line-height: 65px;
                    display: block;
                    color: white;
                    transition: 0.5s; /* it will give some time to the targeted effect */
                }

YEAY you've make your navbar now, next we're gonna go to to fill a little bit of content in your web profile.
