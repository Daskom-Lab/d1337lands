All have been set!

Now we're gonna make the skeleton of web using HTML

=================================

We have seen the teaser of HTML before while setup the environment, and you can see there's a basic structure like:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">

        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>Document</title>
        </head>

        <body>

        </body>

        </html>

At that structure, there's some tag as 

        <body> 
            *something*
        </body>

at HTML, there's opening tag <> and closing tag </>, those tag states some section of the web like head, body, footer, div, etc.
between those tags are the contents of your web. Before we talk about those contents, we're gonna talk about the basic element.

==================================
          BASIC ELEMENT
==================================

See at the basic structure above! we'll talk about the tag:

=> <html> : This element tells the browser that this *index.html* (for example) is HTML Document.
=> <head> : Head element will have some information of the web/html:
    -> <title>
    -> <style>
    -> <base>
    -> <link>
    -> <meta>
    -> <script>
    -> <noscript>
=> <body> : It contains all of the web contents like header, main, footer, and ohter section that developer has.

Aaaaaaaannnnnnnndddddddddddddddddddddd That's all for the HTML, next were gonna talk about *those* contents, Let's go!!!
