Hello again, in this contents, we're gonna learn *something*

When you make a skeleton, we've learnt tags like h1, ul, ol, li, div, id, class, etc.

We can edit those tags appearance with *selector* in your css style sheet, how to?

=================================
           SELECTOR
=================================

=> format : 
                /* selector */ {
                    /* properties: value */
                }

selector has a function to select which tag that will have some style. to select tags like body, div, span, h1, ul, etc. we can simply type:

        div {
            font-size: small;
            color: blue;   
        }
        h1 {
            font-size: small;
            color: blue;   
        }

see the differences now in your index.html at <h1> (remember to add <h1> tags first in your index.html)

you can try for ul too:
        ul {
            color: red;
            margin: 40px;
        }

<--> ID and CLASS SELECTOR <-->

we've seen the normal selector, now how about selector for id and class? (see at content 5_html_section)

for class we can add dot (.) in selector:

        .nama {
            color: red;
            margin: 40px;
        }

and for id we use hashtag (#):

        .login-session {
            color: red;
            margin: 40px;
        }

<--> PSEUDO CLASS SELECTOR <-->

There's a pseudo selector among selector like :hover, :click, :link. those selector are used based on activity of the selector. for example:

        h1:hover {
            font-size: small;
            color: blue;   
        }

That selector means the <h1> will change its color and size while the <h1> text were hovered by mouse.

and there's much more of pseudo that you can learn, you can browse it yourself ^_^

=================================

now we have learn about selector, in the next contents we're gonna learn about styling, whether it's font styling, background, semantic web, container box, etc.

let's go to the next contents!!
