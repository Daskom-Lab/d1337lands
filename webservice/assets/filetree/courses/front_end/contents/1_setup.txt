As I've mentioned, we're gonna use HTML CSS and JS to develop a web, before you code using these language, you must install the intellisense first at Visual Studio Code Extensions, you can simply search "HTML CSS Support" and "JavaScript code snippets". 

Not like a C code compiler, we must set a local server, there is a simple way to make it, we can use "live server" extensions.

To use Live Server, you must install it first. How to install it?

1. Open your Visual Studio Code then go to extensions (ctrl + shift + x), at the extensions, you can search for live server and install it ;)

2. After you install live server, liver server shortcut will appeared on right-bottom corner as "Go Live"

3. To start in local, you can just click Go Live and.... VOILA!!! you'll have your local with default 127.0.0.1


To check if the server is running, you can make a simple web with .html format in your directory, for example:

=> Make a folder named "myWeb" -> Make a new file named "index.html" then open it -> type " ! " at your editor and enter, it will shown a simple HTML code like:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">

        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>Document</title>
        </head>

        <body>

        </body>

        </html>

=> at that code, you can add text "Hello World" between <body></body> -> reload your local and see the result! ;)
