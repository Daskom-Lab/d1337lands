=================================

=================================
1. To add some style to your web, you must have stylesheet file, just make a new file with .css format at your web directory as for before it's "myWeb", 
   for example you can name it as "style.css".

2. After you make a new CSS file, now is the time to add stylesheet in your index.html file at the <head>:
    
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

   So your <head> component now will be:

        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">  <!-- Here's the new!! -->
            <title>Document</title>
        </head>

3. All have been set! now we're gonna decorate your web at the next contents!!
