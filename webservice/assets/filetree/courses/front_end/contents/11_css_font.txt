here we're gonna learn about font styling.

=================================
              FONT
=================================

=> font-family  : 

                font-family: /* value1, value2,...., */ ;

                -> where value is the family font like : sans-serif, Arial.

=> font-size    :

                font-size: /* value */;

                -> size value in CSS can be in px, %, rem, em, vw, vmin, vmax, etc. you can type it as 20px, 50%, 5rem.
                    different between those unit will be learnt later.

=> font-weight  :

                font-weight: /* value */;

                -> font weight used to make a bold text with a certain boldness. the value of boldness is between 100-900 or
                     you can use a descriptive text like: lighter, normal, bold, bolder.

=> font-style   :

                font-style: /* value */;

                -> font style used to give an italic or oblique style to text, the value is a descriptive text: normal, italic, oblique. 
                    try it on your web and see the difference!!

=> shorthand    :

                font: style weight size font-family

                -> we can style a font with all properties that we've learnt with just one property, "font".
                -> example: 
                    
                    1rem sans-serif;

=================================

besides font, we can edit the text too, like line-height, text-indent, text-align, text-transform, text-decoration, etc. You can see it at https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_text.asp
