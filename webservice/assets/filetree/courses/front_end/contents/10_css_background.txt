At the previous content, we learnt about background-color, but actually, you can set the background-image too, let's make it!!

=================================
        BACKGROUND IMAGE
=================================

=> format :
                background-image: url(image-directory)

with that property, you can set the background image, in image directory you can simply set it like (background.png) or else.

you can set more about background position, attachment, repeat, etc. you can see it here : https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_background.asp
