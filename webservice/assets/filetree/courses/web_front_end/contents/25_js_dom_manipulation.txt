Why we manipulate the DOM elements??? of course we're simply want to give some event to the elements, like changing, or actions when clicked,

or add some attribute in that elements, even you can edit the scrolling page.

For example is the first code at 23_js_setup.txt, in that code we use getElementsById() to set which id that we're gonna manipulate, 

and .innerHTML there refer to the property that will be changed, in this case .innerHTML referred to the content of the id.

besides getElementsById(), we can edit another elements to, such as tag, class, scroll, etc. 

there's so much more that we can edit, you can see it at https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_document.asp .
